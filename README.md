# Scrap_engine
by LXGR <lxgr@protonmail.com>

# Installation
Linux:
Copy scrap_engine.py to /usr/lib/python3.8

Windoofs:
Idk, you will figure it out.

# Usage
See scrap_test.py

# Dependencies
scrap_test.py and scrape.py both requier pynput

# Notes
Scrap_engine, scrap_test.py and scrape.py where all tested working in the xfce4-terminal terminal emulator, other terminal emulators will work for sure.
Note that capturing the keyboard using pynput requiers and running xserver, therefore scrape and scrap_test won't in TTY.
To make applications using scrap_engine work in the tty, you need to find another way to capture the keyboard.
